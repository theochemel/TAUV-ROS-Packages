# controllers.yaml
# This is a rosparam yaml that is intended to parameterize the control aggregator node.
# Should be loaded into the "/(model_name)/controllers/configs" namespace.

# List of the controllers available on the vehicle, and default enable status:
# Names of controllers must be consistent with their subnamespace within the controllers namespace.
controllers:
  keyboard:
    enabled: true
  attitude:
    enabled: false

# Topic suffix: this will be appended to the "(controller_name)" namespace to find the output
# topic containing the force wrench from that controller. Eg, if the controller is called
# keyboard, then this will look at keyboard{topic_suffix} for the output wrench.
# Should likely start with a leading slash.
topic_suffix: "/wrench"

# Output frame. All wrench data will be published with respect to this frame. There must
# exist a tf connection between the output_frame and any frame_ids of input wrenches.
output_frame: "albatross/base_link"

# Timout_s: Control inputs will be "remembered" for this long, before being reset to zero if no
# data is received.

# Output topic to publish the resultant wrench to.
